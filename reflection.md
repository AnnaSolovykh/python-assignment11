# Reflection on Data Visualization Techniques

## 1. Differences between static and interactive visualizations

Static visualizations show one fixed view of data, good for reports and presentations. Interactive visualizations let users explore data themselves with hover, zoom, and filtering features. Interactive plots help users discover patterns they might miss in static charts.

## 2. Advantages of dashboards for real-time data exploration

Dashboards provide immediate insights and let users explore data without technical skills. Real-time updates ensure current information for decision-making. Users can filter and drill down into specific areas of interest quickly, making data analysis more accessible to everyone.

## 3. How interactive tools improve data communication

Interactive tools like Plotly and Dash make complex data accessible to non-technical people. During meetings, teams can explore data together and answer questions immediately rather than waiting for new reports. This leads to faster decisions and better collaboration around data-driven insights.
